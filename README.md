Hello! I’m a data professional focused on making higher education better through thoughtful research, transparent analytics, and practical data tools.

Over the past decade, I’ve led institutional research and evaluation work at large research universities, helping leadership make data-informed decisions. I enjoy bridging technical expertise with practical needs, whether that means building dashboards, writing interactive reports, or uncovering patterns in student data using **R** and **Quarto**.

### What I Work On

In my current role, I lead analytics projects that inform university strategy and planning. I’ve also worked on survey design, automated reporting workflows, data governance initiatives, and presenting data to senior leadership in clear, compelling ways.

### I Also Write and Present

I regularly share my work through publications and conference presentations — both methodological and applied. Recent work includes:

- *Community profile data dashboards: Content, design, and definitions* – **Innovative Higher Education**, 2025 ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10755-025-09809-w))  
- *Using AI for text analysis: Approaches and tradeoffs* – NEAIR, 2024  
- *Using HTML widgets for R to create interactive reports* – [eAIR article](https://www.airweb.org/article/2022/10/28/using-html-widgets-for-r-to-create-interactive-reports)  

### Teaching & Mentorship

I’ve taught courses and workshops on **data communication** and **organizational theory and practice in higher education**, and tools like **R and Excel**. I’ve served as a teaching fellow and adjunct instructor in education and leadership programs.

### Tools & Tech I Like

I work across the full data pipeline, from cleaning and wrangling to visualization and delivery. I regularly use many of these tools, and have working proficiency with the rest:

- **Languages & Tools**: R, SQL, Quarto, Tableau, Git, Stata, SPSS  
- **Databases & Data**: Oracle, NoSQL, IPEDS, National Student Clearinghouse  
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub, AWS (S3, EC2, RDS), Tableau Server  
- **Methods**: Survey Design, Statistical Modeling, Program Evaluation, Reporting Automation

### Education

- **Ph.D. in Higher Education**, University of Michigan
- **M.A. in Higher Education**, University of Michigan  
- **Microcertificate in Database Management**, Harvard Extension School
